# analytics_project
Repository housing few code samples from the projects, worked upon previously for skill development &amp; academic purposes 

Here are the details of the sample codes provided:
1) __Bad Loans prediction.R__ : [Loan Defaulter Prediction Model](https://github.com/deeprivu/analytics_project/blob/master/Bad%20Loans%20prediction.R): Exploratory and Predictive analysis done to predict probability of loan default for a consumer financial company based on the past trends. Graphs plotted for Business Presentation using Tableau.

2) __car_assignment.R__: [Car Pricing Prediction Model](https://github.com/deeprivu/analytics_project/blob/master/car_assignment.R): Developed model to predict the carâ€™s price for a new entrant in an existing competitive market, using linear regression, selecting the best model through AIC, adjusted r-square, vif, and p-values (variance <=5%).

3) __casestudy.R__: [Investment Funding Analysis](https://github.com/deeprivu/analytics_project/blob/master/casestudy.R) : EDA analysis to decide on the factors that affect Investment funding of startups.

4) __HR Attrition Case Study.R__: [HR Attrition Model](https://github.com/deeprivu/analytics_project/blob/master/HR%20Attrition%20Case%20Study.R): Developed a model to determine the probability of attrition using a logistic regression with 75% accuracy; confusion matrix; gain & lift charts; AIC. Suggestions provided for the management to retain the best employees.

5) __Uber_Case_Study.R__:[Uber Case Study](https://github.com/deeprivu/analytics_project/blob/master/Uber_Case_Study.R): EDA analysis to interpret and visualise the supply-demand gap airport to-and-fro city

6) __Tensorflow_Train_PAN Card__: [AI Based PAN Card Recognistion](https://github.com/deeprivu/analytics_project/tree/master/Tensorflow_Train_PAN%20Card): Contains Python scripts used for training the mobile net SSD models on PAN card with the help of TensorFlow Object Detection API, which uses Faster R-CNN for training.  
                Following are the description of the Python Files:
                
                  1)Face_recognition_with smartphone_camera_input.py: Useof OpenCV libraries to detect eyes and face, taking input from Samrtphone Camera
                  
                  2)image_recognisition_tensorflow.py: Use of the mobilenet SSD model for image recognisiton, taking input from WebCam
                  
                  3)xml_to_csv_PAN.py: When images were labelled manually using LabelImg, it generated xml files, which was fed in this script to generate a single csv file for both train and test data set.
                  
                  4)generate_tfrecord_PAN.py: Script used to generate tfrecords which was then used using Transfer Learning to train mobilenet SSD with the 'PAN Card' label with a loss of ~1, after tweaking ssd_mobilenet_v1_pets.config. 
                               The output was used to export the trained graph using export_inference_graph.py
